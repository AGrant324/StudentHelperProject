Student help webpage
Hi Team, we have both mine and Alexs websites, we need to pull them together to have only one. We has two because 
Alexs site is already suited to a mobile device and has a form validation and mine has the correct images and pages. As well as mine has been 
trying to acess the database, which i a still trying to implement.
Please can some one finish the google map plug in into that website, it should not be hard. Can someone also help me try to implement the database,
I will create the lecturer website. Tomorrow i have a toutrial in how to implement a website with jack my database teacher.
I should be able to link the two after this.
